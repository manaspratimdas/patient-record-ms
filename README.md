**Patient Record Management System**

The core module of Electronic Health Record (EHR) Microservice to manage the patient record. Manages patient health records and treatment histories. 


**Prompt**

1. As a java developer,develop a comprehensive set of Unit test cases to validate the various scenerio for the methods.use junit5. write the test class and also include the proper dependency in the pom.xml.  Aim to ensure that the schema meets the intended functionalities and can handle different scenarios effectively. Include a mix of positive and negative test cases that encompass a range of potential user interactions.

2. As a Java developer using Java 11, I need a detailed, beginner-friendly guide on generating Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tests using the Cucumber Framework and Junit5 for a microservice. Please provide the following:
  A step-by-step guide on setting up the BDD framework.
    Information on any configuration files that need to be written.
    The necessary dependencies to be imported into the pom file.
  The folder structure that should be followed.
  Please ensure the guide adheres to the best coding practices. Note that I am using the Cucumber Framework for BDD tests for the first time, so please do not assume any prior knowledge.
  The client application is using the following:
      groupId: org.springframework.boot
      artifactId: spring-boot-starter-parent
      version: 2.1.5.RELEASE
   I am also using an application.properties file for configuration.

3. As a Java developer utilizing Java 11, I am seeking to incorporate the Ehcache caching framework into a microservice. Please provide a detailed guide that includes:
  The configuration files that need to be created.
  The necessary dependencies to be imported into the pom file.
  The folder structure to be followed for best practice.
  A step-by-step guide on implementing this framework.  It should be noted that the client application is using the following:
      groupId: org.springframework.boot
      artifactId: spring-boot-starter-parent
      version: 2.1.5.RELEASE
  Also, I am using an application.properties file for configuration. Please ensure that the guide follows best coding practices.

4. As a Java developer using Java 11, I am looking to incorporate robust Error Handling and Resilience mechanisms into a microservice. This should involve implementing strategies for resilience, such as retry policies, circuit breakers, and fallback methods. Please provide a comprehensive guide that includes:
   The essential Maven dependencies to be added.
      Any configuration files that need to be created or updated.
      A step-by-step guide on implementing these strategies.
   Take note that the client application is utilizing the following:
      groupId: org.springframework.boot
      artifactId: spring-boot-starter-parent
      version: 2.1.5.RELEASE
  Additionally, I am using an application.properties file for configuration. Please ensure the guide conforms with the best coding practices.

5. As a Java developer using Java 11, I am seeking to set up role-based access control (RBAC) in a Spring Boot application using Spring security. This will restrict data access based on user roles such as doctors, nurses, and administrators. Please provide:
   The necessary Maven dependencies to be added.
   Any configuration files that need to be created or updated.
   Steps for creating the security configuration class, service class, entity class, and repository class.
   Note that the client application is using the following:
      groupId: org.springframework.boot
      artifactId: spring-boot-starter-parent
      version: 2.1.5.RELEASE
  I am also using an application.properties file for configuration.

6. Continuing from the previous request, I need specifications on the user roles to be defined. Specifically:
    Administrators should be able to insert, delete, update, and view all patient records.
    Nurses should only be able to view patient records.  
    Doctors should be able to view and update records for patients under their care.
  Please provide an initial SQL setup script to create tables for users and roles, as well as scripts to set up a few users with appropriate roles. I am using MySQL as the data store.

7. Finally, I need assistance in crafting Postman requests to invoke the controller methods for getPatientRecord, createPatientRecord, updatePatientRecord, and deletePatientRecord. The Postman setup should also be configured for the various roles. Please provide a step by step guide for this.

8. As a Java developer utilizing Java 11 and the spring-cloud-starter-gateway for creating an API gateway for a microservice system, I seek to implement simple Rate Limiting for the microservice. Please provide a detailed guide that includes:
Any configuration files that need to be created or updated, considering I am using an application.properties file for configuration.
Both server and client configuration details for rate limiting.
The client application is using the following:
groupId: org.springframework.boot
artifactId: spring-boot-starter-parent
version: 2.1.5.RELEASE
Please organize this information in a step-by-step format for ease of implementation.
